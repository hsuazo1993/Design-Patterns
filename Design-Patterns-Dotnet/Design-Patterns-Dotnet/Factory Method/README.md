# Factory Pattern

**Definition:** The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Purpose:**

*   **Decouple object creation from its implementation:**  Hides the object creation logic from the client.
*   **Promote loose coupling:**  Reduces dependencies between the client and concrete classes.
*   **Improve code flexibility:**  Makes it easier to add or modify object creation logic without affecting the client code.
*   **Enhance code testability:**  Allows you to easily test object creation logic in isolation.

**Case of Usage:**

*   When you need to create objects but you don't know the exact class of the object that will be created at compile time.
*   When you want to provide a simple way for clients to create objects without exposing the object creation logic.
*   When you want to enforce a consistent way of creating objects in your application.

**Example:**

Imagine you have a game with different types of enemies, such as goblins, orcs, and dragons. You can use the Factory pattern to create an `EnemyFactory` class that has a method for creating enemies based on their type. Then, you can use this factory to create different types of enemies without knowing their exact class beforehand.

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced complexity:**  Simplifies object creation and hides unnecessary details from the client.
*   **Increased flexibility:**  Makes it easier to add or modify object creation logic.
*   **Improved code reusability:**  The factory can be reused to create different types of objects.

**Relevant Information:**

*   The Factory pattern is often used in conjunction with other creational patterns, such as the Abstract Factory pattern and the Prototype pattern.
*   The Factory pattern is particularly useful in situations where the object creation process is complex or involves a large number of optional parameters.

**In .NET:**

*   The `Activator.CreateInstance()` method in .NET can be used to implement the Factory pattern.
*   The Factory pattern can be used to create different types of controllers or services in ASP.NET Core applications.
*   The Factory pattern can be used to create different types of entities in Entity Framework Core.
