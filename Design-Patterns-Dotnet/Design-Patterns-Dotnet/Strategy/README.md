# Strategy Pattern

**Definition:** The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Purpose:**

*   **Define a family of algorithms:**  Encapsulates different algorithms or behaviors into separate classes.
*   **Encapsulate algorithms:**  Hides the implementation details of each algorithm from the client.
*   **Make algorithms interchangeable:**  Allows clients to switch between algorithms at runtime without modifying their code.
*   **Promote code reusability:**  The algorithms can be reused in different contexts.

**Case of Usage:**

*   When you have multiple algorithms or behaviors for performing a specific task.
*   When you want to allow clients to choose an algorithm at runtime.
*   When you want to avoid using conditional statements to select an algorithm.

**Example:**

Imagine you have an e-commerce application that offers different shipping options, such as FedEx, UPS, and USPS. You can use the Strategy pattern to create a `ShippingStrategy` interface with concrete implementations for each shipping provider. Then, you can allow the user to select their preferred shipping method at checkout, and the application will use the corresponding strategy to calculate the shipping cost.

**Benefits:**

*   **Flexibility:** You can easily add new algorithms or modify existing ones without affecting the client code.
*   **Maintainability:** The code is more organized and easier to maintain.
*   **Testability:** The algorithms can be tested independently of the client code.

**Relevant Information:**

*   The Strategy pattern is often used in conjunction with other behavioral patterns, such as the Template Method pattern.
*   The Strategy pattern is particularly useful in situations where the behavior of an object needs to be changed dynamically at runtime.

**In .NET:**

*   The `IComparer<T>` and `IComparable<T>` interfaces in .NET are examples of the Strategy pattern.
*   The Strategy pattern can be used to implement different validation rules in ASP.NET Core applications.
*   The Strategy pattern can be used to define different payment processing methods in an e-commerce application.
